# NumericalCognitionChicks
Repository for study on chciks

In each folder you can find the auditory stimuli used for each experiment of the thesis.

Experiment 1a, Experiment 1b and Experiment 2
Each folder contains the sound used during the test session. As we controlled both for first numerosity played and first side of the apparatus played, there are a total of 4 possible combinations (due to GitHub size limitations only 2 per experiments have been uploaded). 


Experiment 3
In this experiment a single numerosity was played in background. To avoid positional biases we balanced the position of the first reproduction (half of the time on the left and half of the time on the right, for each numerosity)


Experiment 4
Experiment 4 had no sound during test, so only the two imprinting sequences have been uploaded

# NumericalCognitionChicks
Repository for study on chicks

In each folder, you can find the auditory stimuli used for each thesis experiment.

**Experiment 1a, Experiment 1b and Experiment 2**

Each folder contains the sound used during the test session. As we controlled both for the first numerosity played and the first side of the apparatus played, there are a total of 4 possible combinations 

**Experiment 3**

In this experiment, a single numerosity was played in the background. To avoid positional biases we balanced the position of the first reproduction (half of the time on the left and half of the time on the right, for each numerosity)


**Experiment 4**

This experiment had no sound during the test, so only the two imprinting sequences have been uploaded
